## Mutation coverage with snapshot testing

You will be creating a testing analysis that will blend several techniques, including fuzzing, and snapshot testing.

The goal of the analysis is to calculate the mutation coverage of a test suite.

### Checkbox (marqdown)

The system under test will be [an microservice](https://github.com/chrisparnin/checkbox.io-micro-preview) extracted from a markdown-based survey site.

The test suite includes the following test markdown files:
- test/resources/long.md
- test/resources/survey.md
- test/resources/upload.md
- test/resources/variations.md

Starting service can be acheived by installing node modules and running the service.

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

The rendered survey is accessible on `http://localhost:3000/survey/{filename}`

1. **Generate snapshots**.

An [example implementation](https://github.com/ruttabega/screenshot) of a headless browser image-based snapshot is provided.

3. **Mutation operators**.

Implement the following mutation operations (with examples).
   - Conditional boundary mutations: `>` => `>=`, `<=` `<=`
   - Incremental mutations: `++j` =>`j++`, `i++` => `i--`
   - Negate conditionals: `==` => `!=`, `>` => `<`
   - Mutate control flow `if` => `else if`
   - Conditional expression mutation `&&` => `||`, `||` => `&&`
   - Clone return, early _Find_: `return embeddedHtml;`, _copy and insert_ in random location of function (before declaration).
   - Non-empty string: `""` => `"<div>Bug</div>"`.
   - Constant Replacement: `0` => `3`

An [example implementation](https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/ASTRewrite) of a mutation operator is provided.

4. Generate 1000 mutations, randomly applying one mutation operator, in a random applicable location of code. Calculate

Checkbox? Python? What can be fuzzed? Input, code?

Snapshot as alternative to crash?
