## Mutation coverage with snapshot testing

You will be creating a testing analysis that will blend several techniques, including fuzzing, and snapshot testing.
The goal of the analysis is to calculate the mutation coverage.

A small api that renders a given markdown file as a survey.

1. Generate or given inputs as test suite.
2. **Generate snapshots**.



3. **Mutation operators**.

Implement the following mutation operations (with examples).
   - Conditional boundary mutations: `>` => `>=`, `<=` `<=`
   - Incremental mutations: `++j` =>`j++`, `i++` => `i--`
   - Negate conditionals: `==` => `!=`, `>` => `<`
   - Mutate control flow `if` => `else if`
   - Conditional expression mutation `&&` => `||`, `||` => `&&`
   - Clone return, early _Find_: `return embeddedHtml;`, _copy and insert_ in random location of function (before declaration).
   - Non-empty string: `""` => `"<div>Bug</div>"`.
   - Constant Replacement: `0` => `3`

4. Generate 1000 mutations, randomly applying one mutation operator, in a random applicable location of code. Calculate

Checkbox? Python? What can be fuzzed? Input, code?

Snapshot as alternative to crash?
