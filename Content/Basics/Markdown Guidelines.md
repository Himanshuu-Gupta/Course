# Markdown Guidelines

Your `README.md` is your primary way of showcasing your work. You want to make it both easy to view and find material in your submission. Following are some good practices to consider:

1. **Headings** help you organize content into different sections. Different Heading sizes are a good way to represent sub-sections within sections.

2. Images can be used to help show key parts of your program running or demonstrate that you've met key requirements. In most cases, images should be **embedded** in your markdown files to illustrate your work.

3. Videos/Screencasts become a better choice of demonstrating your program when screenshots cannot clearly illustrate what you want to demonstrate. It is a good practice to **upload** your videos on an online viewable platform (YouTube, Google Drive, etc) and then **link** them in your markdown file.

4. Including code scripts through the **inline code** syntax or the **fenced code block** syntax will help your code have a richer representation in your markdown, since it will take care of the code formatting.

5. To make your work more accessible and understandable, **linking** all necessary files in your markdown will ensure that none of the work you have done gets overlooked.
